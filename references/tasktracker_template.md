# 📝 Task Tracker

## 🔮 Future
- [ ] _placeholder task_

## 📥 Backlog
- [ ] _placeholder task_

## ⏳ Pending / In-Progress
- [ ] _placeholder task_

## ✅ Done
- [x] _placeholder task_
```

**Use—one quiet note**
Shift tasks downward through the sections as they move from idea (Future) → Backlog → Pending → Done. Toggle `[ ]` to `[x]` only in **Done**.
